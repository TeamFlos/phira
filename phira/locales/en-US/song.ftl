  3. Make sure the chart (including illustration, audio, and any storyboarding assets) complies with Phira's ToS, the regulations of the Peoples' Republic of China, and not contain any bad information or violate the law.
  4. Your chart may be used for promotional purposes by Phira.  We will contact you if we want to use your chart for any other purposes.
  5. Phira reserves the right to remove your chart after it has been approved (change in ToS, copyright, etc.).
